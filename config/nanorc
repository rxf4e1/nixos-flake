## Sample initialization file for GNU nano
## Please note that you must have configured nano with --enable-nanorc
## for this file to be read!  Also note that characters specially
## interpreted by the shell should not be escaped here.
##
## To make sure a value is not enabled, use "unset <option>"
##
## For the options that take parameters, the default value is given.
## Other options are unset by default.

# set boldtext

## Use auto-indentation
set autoindent

# set backup

## Constantly display the cursor position in the status bar.
set constantshow

## Use cut to end of line with ^K by default
# set cutfromcursor

## Set the line length for wrapping text and justifying paragraphs.
## If fill is negative, the line length will be the screen width less
## this number.
##
set fill 80

## Draw a vertical stripe at the given column, to help
## judge the width of the text.
# set guidestripe 80

## The opening and closing brackets that can be found by bracket
## searches.  They cannot contain blank characters.  The former set must
## come before the latter set, and both must be in the same order.
##
set matchbrackets "(<[{)>]}"

##

## Allow multiple file buffers (using ^R inserts into separate buffer).
## You must have configured with --enable-multibuffer or --enable-extra

## Set operating directory.  nano will not read or write files outside
## this directory and its subdirectories.  Also, the current directory
## is changed to here, so files are inserted from this dir.  A blank
## string means the operating directory feature is turned off.
##
# set operatingdir ""

## Preserve the XON and XOFF keys (^Q and ^S)
# set preserve

## The email-quote string, used to justify email-quoted paragraphs.
## This is an extended regular expression if your system supports them,
## otherwise a literal string.  Default:
# set quotestr "^([ 	]*[\|>:}#])+"
## if you have regexps, otherwise:
# set quotestr "> "
## You can get old nano quoted-justify behavior via:
# set quotestr "(> )+"

## Do extended regular expression searches by default
set regexp

# Use smarthome
set smarthome

## Use this spelling checker instead of the internal one.  This option
## does not properly have a default value.

# set tempfile

## Disallow file modification, why would you want this in an rc file? ;)

## of tabs and spaces.  187 in ISO 8859-1 (0000BB in Unicode) and 183 in
## ISO-8859-1 (0000B7 in Unicode) seem to be good values for these.
set whitespace ". "
